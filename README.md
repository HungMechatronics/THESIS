# THESIS
Warehouse Management System was designed to manage and operate AGV system based on KIVA fulfillment system.
Some features can be mentioned:
- Grid layout with 1960 pods ( single unit shelf ) & over 2000 nodes.
- 8 AGVs with coutinously feedback odometry.
- Auto & manual control for mission distributing.
- Goods managements & pods position tracking.
- Corruption avoidance ( uncompleted ).
